                The fusion process intelligently blends visual traits, type combinations, ability pools, and stat distributions to create biologically plausible hybrids. Use our <strong>Pokemon fusion generator online</strong> to upload clear images of two Pokemon, select your preferred fusion style (Balanced Hybrid, Type-Dominant, Mega Evolution Style, Regional Variant, or Shiny Palette), and watch as the generator produces a high-resolution <strong>Pokemon fusion image</strong> complete with suggested typing, abilities, and Pokedex-style flavor text.
